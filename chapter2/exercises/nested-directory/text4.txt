Innovations such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and Internet of Things (IoT) are not just reshaping the way we conduct business, but also challenging our ethical frameworks and societal norms. These technologies hold the promise of solving some of the most pressing global challenges, from climate change to healthcare. However, they also raise important questions about privacy, security, and the digital divide. The need for a thoughtful dialogue that includes technologists, policymakers, and the public has never been more important, ensuring that technological advancements benefit all of humanity.
